      <p>Paul Scholes was interviewed for the Oldham Athletic manager’s job on Wednesday morning, with the club now deciding whether to give the former<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/manchester-united">Manchester United</a> and England midfielder the role.</p>
      <p>Scholes was formerly a coach at United but this would be his first permanent No1 position should he be appointed. Scholes is a part-owner of Salford City and he was briefly caretaker manager of the club in 2015.</P>
      <p>At United the 42-year-old was a reserve -team coach under Sir Alex Ferguson before <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jan/08/manchester-united-paul-scholes-city">he came out of retirement in January 2012</a> to resume his playing career. When retiring for good in May 2013, Scholes took coaching positions when David Moyes managed the club and briefly when Ryan Giggs was interim manager for four games at the close of the 2013-14 campaign, after the former was sacked.</p>
      <p>The Oldham job is vacant after John Sheridan was <a href="http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/oldham-athletic-sack-john-sheridan-13669476">sacked on 25 September.</a> The club are 19th in League One with just 10 points from their opening 11 games, winning just three fixtures so far this season.</p>
      <p>Scholes grew up in the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/oldham">Oldham</a> area and has been a regular at Boundary Park since retiring. Richie Wellens, who was also at United when a young player, has been the caretaker manager since Sheridan’s departure. He has guided the Latics to three straight wins since taking over.</p>
      <p>While Oldham declined to comment when contacted, it is understood Simon Corney, the owner, wants to make a permanent appointment as soon as possible.</p>
